## 📋 Frequency Types Implemented (36 Total)

### Basic Frequencies (3)
- ✅ `once_off` - Appears daily until done, never auto-locks
- ✅ `every_day` - Daily instances excluding Sundays & PHs, locks at 23:59
- ✅ `once_weekly` - Monday-anchored, carries through Saturday

### Specific Weekdays (6)
- ✅ `monday` - Appears on Monday, carries through Saturday
- ✅ `tuesday` - Appears on Tuesday, carries through Saturday
- ✅ `wednesday` - Appears on Wednesday, carries through Saturday
- ✅ `thursday` - Appears on Thursday, carries through Saturday
- ✅ `friday` - Appears on Friday, carries through Saturday
- ✅ `saturday` - Appears on Saturday, carries through Saturday

### Monthly Frequencies (3)
- ✅ `once_monthly` - Same appearance as start of month, due last Saturday
- ✅ `start_of_every_month` - 1st of month with shifts, +5 workdays due
- ✅ `end_of_every_month` - Last Monday with ≥5 workdays remaining

### Start of Specific Months (12)
- ✅ `start_of_month_jan` through `start_of_month_dec`
- ✅ Each follows start-of-month rules for specific month only

### End of Specific Months (12)
- ✅ `end_of_month_jan` through `end_of_month_dec`
- ✅ Each follows end-of-month rules for specific month only

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### Deterministic Logic

- ✅ Consistent results across multiple runs
- ✅ Predictable behavior for all edge cases

### Public Holiday Integration
- ✅ Proper date shifting (Monday PH → Tuesday, etc.)
- ✅ Skip behavior for Every Day tasks
- ✅ Workday counting excludes weekends and holidays

### Weekend Handling
- ✅ Saturday/Sunday logic per specifications
- ✅ Weekend → Monday shifting for monthly tasks
- ✅ Business day calculations

### Carry Behavior
- ✅ Same instance continues across days when specified
- ✅ Different carry rules per frequency type
- ✅ Proper cutoff handling

### Status Transitions
- ✅ **Pending** → **Overdue** (at due time on due date)
- ✅ **Overdue** → **Missed** (at specified cutoffs)
- ✅ **Missed** → **Locked** (automatically)
- ✅ Any status → **Done** (when completed)

### Due Date Calculations
- ✅ Workday counting (excludes weekends/PHs)
- ✅ Holiday extensions when due date lands on PH
- ✅ Different rules per frequency type

### Australian Timezone Support
- ✅ All calculations in Australia/Sydney timezone
- ✅ DST handling
- ✅ Business hours alignment

## 🎯 Frequency-Specific Rules Implemented

### 1. Once Off
- **Appear**: On first eligible day (active & after publish_at)
- **Carry**: Same instance appears daily until Done
- **Due**: Admin-entered manually (required)
- **Lock**: Never auto-miss/lock

### 2. Every Day
- **Appear**: Daily excluding Sundays & PHs (skip, no shift)
- **Carry**: No carry; each day has own instance
- **Due**: Same day
- **Lock**: 23:59 same date → Missed + Lock

### 3. Once Weekly
- **Appear**: Monday (PH → Tue → next weekday forward)
- **Carry**: Daily through Saturday of week
- **Due**: Saturday (or nearest earlier non-PH weekday)
- **Lock**: 23:59 on due date → Missed + Lock

### 4. Every Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Fri/Sat
- **Appear**: Specified weekday with PH shifting
- **Carry**: Daily through Saturday of week
- **Due**: Scheduled day (after PH shift)
- **Lock**: 23:59 on Saturday cutoff → Missed + Lock

### 5. Start of Every Month
- **Appear**: 1st (Sat/Sun → first Monday; PH → next weekday)
- **Carry**: Daily through last Saturday of month
- **Due**: +5 workdays from appearance (PH → extend)
- **Lock**: 23:59 on last Saturday → Missed + Lock

### 6. Start of Specific Months
- **Appear**: Same as Start of Every Month but specific month only
- **Carry**: Same as Start of Every Month
- **Due**: Same as Start of Every Month
- **Lock**: Same as Start of Every Month

### 7. Once Monthly
- **Appear**: Same as Start of Month
- **Carry**: Only through due date (not past)
- **Due**: Last Saturday (or nearest earlier non-PH)
- **Lock**: 23:59 on due date → Missed + Lock

### 8. End of Every Month
- **Appear**: Last Monday with ≥5 workdays (else prior Monday)
- **Carry**: Through Saturday of that week only
- **Due**: Last Saturday (or nearest earlier non-PH)
- **Lock**: 23:59 on due date → Missed + Lock

### 9. End of Specific Months
- **Appear**: Same as End of Every Month but specific month only
- **Carry**: Same as End of Every Month
- **Due**: Same as End of Every Month
- **Lock**: Same as End of Every Month
