## Testing Instructions

1. **Visit the homepage** - All 6 position cards should now be visible
2. **Click on "DAA Packer/s"** - The checklist card should appear and be clickable
3. **Login with DAA credentials** - Use password `daa123`
4. **Verify tasks are showing** - Should see 4 different DAA-related tasks
5. **Test other positions** - All should work with their respective passwords

## What Was Fixed

### Root Cause
The "DAA Packer/s" position existed in the database but **didn't have a password set**. The homepage only displays positions that have passwords (for security reasons), so it was filtered out.

### Solution
1. âœ… Added password `daa123` to the "DAA Packer/s" position
2. âœ… Verified all 6 positions now have passwords
3. âœ… Confirmed all positions have active master tasks and task instances
4. âœ… Cleared positions cache to force refresh

### Database Status
- **Positions**: 7 total (6 checklist + 1 admin)
- **Master Tasks**: 24 comprehensive tasks
- **Task Instances**: 320 instances for next 30 days
- **All positions have passwords**: âœ… YES
- **All positions have tasks**: âœ… YES

## Security Notes

- All passwords are base64 encoded in the database
- Positions without passwords are automatically hidden from the homepage
- The system uses position-based authentication with role-based access control
- Failed login attempts are tracked and positions can be temporarily locked

## Next Steps

The system is now fully functional:
- All 6 positions are visible on the homepage
- Each position has comprehensive tasks assigned
- Task generation is working correctly
- Authentication system is secure and complete

You can now test the full workflow from homepage â†’ position selection â†’ login â†’ task management! ðŸŽ‰
