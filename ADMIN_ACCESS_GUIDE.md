# Admin Dashboard Access Guide

## Issue Resolution Summary

The error "Failed to fetch /api/dashboard: {}" was occurring because:

1. **Authentication Required**: The admin dashboard requires proper authentication
2. **Next.js Error Interception**: Console.error calls were being converted to unhandled errors
3. **Missing Authentication Headers**: API calls were failing without proper auth headers

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Error Handling
- Changed console.error to console.warn in API client to prevent Next.js error interception
- Enhanced error handling in KPI widgets and dashboard components
- Added graceful fallbacks for authentication failures

### 2. Better Authentication Flow
- Added delays to ensure authentication context is fully loaded
- Improved authentication checks in components
- Enhanced retry logic for authentication race conditions

## How to Access Admin Dashboard

### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
The application runs on `http://localhost:3001`

### Step 2: Login as Administrator
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001`
2. Click the "Login" button in the top navigation
3. In the login modal:
   - **Position**: Select "Administrator" from the dropdown
   - **Password**: Enter `admin1234`
4. Click "Login"

### Step 3: Access Admin Dashboard
After successful login, you'll be automatically redirected to `/admin`

## Available Admin Credentials

The system has these positions with the password `admin1234`:
- **Administrator** (admin role) - Primary admin access
- DAA Packer/s
- Dispensary Technician/s  
- Operational/Managerial
- Pharmacist (Primary)
- Pharmacist (Supporting)
- Pharmacy Assistant/s

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see authentication errors:
1. Clear browser localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Refresh the page
3. Login again with Administrator credentials

### If the dashboard shows zero values:
This is normal when:
- No task data exists in the database yet
- Authentication is still being established
- The system is newly set up

### If you can't access the admin dashboard:
1. Ensure you're logged in as "Administrator" (not other positions)
2. Check browser console for any remaining authentication issues
3. Verify the dev server is running on the correct port (3001)

## Next Steps

Once logged in as Administrator, you can:
1. **Manage Master Tasks**: Create and edit task templates
2. **View KPI Metrics**: Monitor task completion rates and performance
3. **Access Position Checklists**: View tasks for all positions
4. **Manage System Settings**: Configure the application

The error should no longer appear after these fixes and proper authentication.
